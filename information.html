					Functional clothing is a prerequisite for learning to dance.
					There are many different types of clothing available for sale,
					but the best plan of action might be to start with the basics, and then build
					from there.
					If special costumes or additional items are required,
					you are better off acquiring them as needed rather than stockpiling items with
					the possibility
					they will remain unused or unneeded.<br>
				</p>

					<h5>Body Attire</h5><br>
					Female students should wear a leotard and pink tights. <br>
					Male dancers will require a white t-shirt and black leggings.<br>
					All clothing items can be purchased from a dancewear (shop), either in store or
					online,
					however you may prefer to buy in-person in order to try different sizes
					first.<br>
				</p>

					<h5>Ballet Shoes</h5><br>
					Girls typically wear pink ballet slippers; boys require either black or white
					slippers.
					You must make sure that the slippers fit correctly:
					snugly, but not too tightly, as the toes should be able to move around.
					Shoes can also be half a size larger than the normal shoes your children wear,
					as this will allow for growth;
					however, it is inadvisable to wear shoes that are too large.

					Ballet shoes are either made of leather or canvas, with leather being the more
					expensive option.
					As long as the shoes are correctly sized, the material of construction is about
					personal choice based on “feel.”
					Know that canvas shoes will be easier to clean, as they are machine-washable.
					If you have younger children, you may look for ballet shoes that have pre-sewn
					elastics on them.<br>

					<h5>Hairstyle</h5><br>
					Ideally, girls’ hair will be pulled back, very neatly into a (bun).
					This is where the term “bunheads” comes from. There are a variety of ways to
					achieve this hairstyle,
					but one simple method is to brush your child’s hair until it is smooth; form it
					into a ponytail;
					then using an elastic or hair wrap to secure their hair tightly near the top of
					their hair.
					This is the classic ballerina bun, although many other variations are
					functional.
					If boys are sporting longer hair, it too, should be pulled back.
