                    My name is Tracy Chaston, and I am a co-owner and Ballet teacher at The
                    Peninsula
                    Ballet School.
                    I have always wanted to teach ballet, and started teacher training after
                    matriculating.
                    I have been teaching for 30 years.

                    I received my teachers certificate and did further exams on anatomy and child
                    psychology and development for my Teachers Diploma.
                    I am a teaching member of The Royal Academy of Dance, which is the method we
                    teach.

                    At our school we do shows, R.A.D examinations and Eistedfodd's.

                    I have always been passionate about teaching and strive to make it accessible to
                    all
                    by teaching the fundamentals of ballet through
                    classical technique.
                    Ballet is a fantastic grounding which teaches co-ordination, discipline,
                    musicality
                    and a good work ethic of daily practice, which is
                    a necessity in today's world.
                    Through my years of teaching, I watch my pupils/students learn, practice,
                    improve,
                    and grow, to see them overcome obstacles and to be
                    a part of their lives is such a privilege for me. Transforming children and
                    adults
                    into dancers.

                    My name is Leilani Beer and I teach RAD ballet and Alianza flamenco. I have
                    taught
                    ballet for 13 years (2006-2019), and have in this
                    past year begun teaching flamenco.
                    In my personal capacity I have produced Resurrection (2015-2017) and Creation
                    and
                    the Cornerstone (2018). Further, during my 13 years
                    of teaching, I have co-produced and choreographed studio shows with other dance
                    teachers, and prepared students for RAD examinations.
                    For my education I have a Certificate in Ballet Teaching Studies through the
                    Royal
                    Academy of Dance; an MA through UNISA; and am
                    currently busy with a PhD, also through UNISA.
                    I am a member of the RAD, with Registered Teacher status. During my bachelor
                    degree
                    I received a Golden Key International Award, and
                    throughout my studies received Merit Award Bursaries.
                    I believe in sharing beauty and self-empowerment through dance, with the aim to
                    strive for excellence at the level of each student.

              <p>
                In 1975, Sandra Davis started a Ballet School in Fish Hoek, she was a teaching
                member
                of
                The Royal Academy of Dance.
                She did many shows through the years and entered many R.A.D examinations, her studio
                was
                well known.
                Tracy and Leilani were both trained by Sandra at her studio.
                In 1990 Tracy teamed up with Sandra and they taught together for many years until
                Sandra
                sadly passed away. In 1999 Tracy took over the studio.
                Leilani also opened a Ballet Studio in Fish Hoek, - The Leilani Beer School of
                Ballet.
                In 2011, Tracy and Leilani joined their respective studios and co-founded The
                Peninsula
                Ballet School.

                The Peninsula Ballet School holds classes in Fish Hoek, Kommetjie and Muizenberg
