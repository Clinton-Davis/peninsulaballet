                      <p>
                        My name is Tracy Chaston, and I am a co-owner and Ballet teacher at The
                        Peninsula
                        Ballet School.
                        I have always wanted to teach ballet and started teacher training after
                        matriculating.
                        I have been teaching for 30 years.

                        I received my teacher's certificate and did further exams on anatomy and
                        child
                        psychology and development for my Teachers Diploma.
                        I am a teaching member of The Royal Academy of Dance, which is the method we
                        teach.

                        At our school, we do shows, R.A.D examinations and Eistedfodd's.

                        I have always been passionate about teaching and strive to make it
                        accessible
                        to
                        all
                        by teaching the fundamentals of ballet through
                        classical technique.
                        Ballet is a fantastic grounding which teaches co-ordination, discipline,
                        musicality
                        and a good work ethic of daily practice, which is
                        a necessity in today's world.
                        Through my years of teaching, I watch my pupils/students learn, practice,
                        improve,
                        and grow, to see them overcome obstacles and to be
                        a part of their lives is such a privilege for me. Transforming children and
                        adults
                        into dancers.</p>

                      <p>My name is Leilani Beer and I teach RAD ballet and Alianza flamenco. I have
                        taught
                        ballet for 13 years (2006-2019), and have in this
                        past year begun teaching flamenco.
                        In my personal capacity I have produced Resurrection (2015-2017) and
                        Creation
                        and
                        the Cornerstone (2018). Further, during my 13 years
                        of teaching, I have co-produced and choreographed studio shows with other
                        dance
                        teachers, and prepared students for RAD examinations.
                        For my education I have a Certificate in Ballet Teaching Studies through the
                        Royal
                        Academy of Dance; an MA through UNISA; and am
                        currently busy with a PhD, also through UNISA.
                        I am a member of the RAD, with Registered Teacher status. During my bachelor
                        degree
                        I received a Golden Key International Award, and
                        throughout my studies received Merit Award Bursaries.
                        I believe in sharing beauty and self-empowerment through dance, with the aim
                        to
                        strive for excellence at the level of each student.</p>

                <p>
                  In 1975, Sandra Davis started a Ballet School in Fish Hoek, she was a teaching
                  member
                  of
                  The Royal Academy of Dance.
                  She did many shows through the years and entered many R.A.D examinations, her
                  studio
                  was
                  well known.
                  Tracy and Leilani were both trained by Sandra at her studio.
                  In 1990 Tracy teamed up with Sandra and they taught together for many years until
                  Sandra
                  sadly passed away. In 1999 Tracy took over the studio.
                  Leilani also opened a Ballet Studio in Fish Hoek, - The Leilani Beer School of
                  Ballet.
                  In 2011, Tracy and Leilani joined their respective studios and co-founded The
                  Peninsula
                  Ballet School.
                  The Peninsula Ballet School holds classes in Fish Hoek, Kommetjie and Muizenberg
