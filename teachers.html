                My name is Tracy Chaston, and I am a co-owner and Ballet teacher at The Peninsula
                Ballet School.
                I have always wanted to teach ballet, and started teacher training after
                matriculating.
                I have been teaching for 30 years.

                I received my teachers certificate and did further exams on anatomy and child
                psychology and development for my Teachers Diploma.
                I am a teaching member of The Royal Academy of Dance, which is the method we teach.

                At our school we do shows, R.A.D examinations and Eistedfodd's.

                I have always been passionate about teaching and strive to make it accessible to all
                by teaching the fundamentals of ballet through
                classical technique.
                Ballet is a fantastic grounding which teaches co-ordination, discipline, musicality
                and a good work ethic of daily practice, which is
                a necessity in today's world.
                Through my years of teaching, I watch my pupils/students learn, practice, improve,
                and grow, to see them overcome obstacles and to be
                a part of their lives is such a privilege for me. Transforming children and adults
                into dancers.

              <div class="card-text text-center">
                My name is Leilani Beer and I teach RAD ballet and Alianza flamenco. I have taught
                ballet for 13 years (2006-2019), and have in this
                past year begun teaching flamenco.
                In my personal capacity I have produced Resurrection (2015-2017) and Creation and
                the Cornerstone (2018). Further, during my 13 years
                of teaching, I have co-produced and choreographed studio shows with other dance
                teachers, and prepared students for RAD examinations.
                For my education I have a Certificate in Ballet Teaching Studies through the Royal
                Academy of Dance; an MA through UNISA; and am
                currently busy with a PhD, also through UNISA.
                I am a member of the RAD, with Registered Teacher status. During my bachelor degree
                I received a Golden Key International Award, and
                throughout my studies received Merit Award Bursaries.
                I believe in sharing beauty and self-empowerment through dance, with the aim to
                strive for excellence at the level of each student.

          <p>
            In 1975, Sandra Davis started a Ballet School in Fish Hoek, she was a teaching member of
            The Royal Academy of Dance.
            She did many shows through the years and entered many R.A.D examinations, her studio was
            well known.
            Tracy and Leilani were both trained by Sandra at her studio.
            In 1990 Tracy teamed up with Sandra and they taught together for many years until Sandra
            sadly passed away. In 1999 Tracy took over the studio.
            Leilani also opened a Ballet Studio in Fish Hoek, - The Leilani Beer School of Ballet.
            In 2011, Tracy and Leilani joined their respective studios and co-founded The Peninsula
            Ballet School.

            The Peninsula Ballet School holds classes in Fish Hoek, Kommetjie and Muizenberg
