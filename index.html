        <h2 class="subHeadings">The Benefits</h2>
        <p class="centered" id="welcomePara">There are so many benefits to learning ballet, besides having fun and
          making good
          friends, it promotes healthy living as it is great exercise.<br>
          Being flexible is very important in ballet, it helps stop injury
          and promotes muscle strength and in turn good posture.<br>
          Not only is it great for your physical wellbeing but mental strength too.<br>
          It teaches children how to stay focused and learn from there mistakes, which
          leads to perseverance and a huge boost in self-confidence when they get it
          right.
          These are just a few of the benefits that will stay with them for life.</p>

        <p>
          My name is Tracy Chaston, and I am a co-owner and Ballet teacher at The
          Peninsula Ballet School.
          I have always wanted to teach ballet and started teacher training after
          matriculating. I have been teaching for 30 years.
          I received my teacher's certificate and did further exams on anatomy and child
          psychology and development for my Teachers Diploma.
          I am a teaching member of The Royal Academy of Dance, which is the method we
          teach. At our school, we do shows, R.A.D examinations and Eistedfodd's.

          I have always been passionate about teaching and strive to make it accessible
          to all by teaching the fundamentals of ballet through classical technique.
          Ballet is a fantastic grounding which teaches co-ordination, discipline, musicality
          and a good work ethic of daily practice, which is
          a necessity in today's world.
          Through my years of teaching, I watch my pupils/students learn, practice,
          improve, and grow, to see them overcome obstacles and to be
          a part of their lives is such a privilege for me. Transforming children and
          adults into dancers.</p>

        <h2 class="headFont" id="">Leilani Beer </h2>
        <p>My name is Leilani Beer and I teach RAD ballet and Alianza flamenco. I have
          taught ballet for 13 years (2006-2019), and have in this
          past year begun teaching flamenco.
          In my personal capacity I have produced Resurrection (2015-2017) and
          Creation and the Cornerstone (2018). Further, during my 13 years
          of teaching, I have co-produced and choreographed studio shows with other
          dance teachers, and prepared students for RAD examinations.
          For my education I have a Certificate in Ballet Teaching Studies through the
          Royal Academy of Dance; an MA through UNISA; and am
          currently busy with a PhD, also through UNISA.
          I am a member of the RAD, with Registered Teacher status. During my bachelor
          degree I received a Golden Key International Award, and
          throughout my studies received Merit Award Bursaries.
          I believe in sharing beauty and self-empowerment through dance, with the aim
          to strive for excellence at the level of each student.</p>

        <h2 class="headFont ">A Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          In 1975, Sandra Davis started a Ballet School in Fish Hoek, she was a teaching
          member of The Royal Academy of Dance.
          She did many shows through the years and entered many R.A.D examinations, her
          studio was well known.
          Tracy and Leilani were both trained by Sandra at her studio.
          In 1990 Tracy teamed up with Sandra and they taught together for many years until
          Sandra sadly passed away. In 1999 Tracy took over the studio.
          Leilani also opened a Ballet Studio in Fish Hoek, - The Leilani Beer School of
          Ballet.
          In 2011, Tracy and Leilani joined their respective studios and co-founded The
          Peninsula Ballet School.

      <h3 class="subHeadings">What To Wear</h3>
      <p>
        Functional clothing is a prerequisite for learning to dance.
        There are many different types of clothing available for sale,
        but the best plan of action might be to start with the basics, and
        then build from there.
        If special costumes or additional items are required,
        you are better off acquiring them as needed rather than stockpiling
        items with the possibility they will remain unused or unneeded.<br></p>

      <h2 class="headFont">Body Attire</h2><br>
      <p>Female students should wear a leotard and pink tights. <br>
        Male dancers will require a white t-shirt and black leggings.<br>
        All clothing items can be purchased from a dancewear Outlets, either
        in store or online,
        however you may prefer to buy in-person in order to try different
        sizes first.<br></p>

      <h2 class="headFont">Ballet Shoes</h2><br>
      <p> Girls typically wear pink ballet slippers; boys require either black
        or white slippers.
        You must make sure that the slippers fit correctly:
        snugly, but not too tightly, as the toes should be able to move around.
        However, it is inadvisable to wear shoes that are too large.
        Ballet shoes are either made of leather or canvas, with leather
        being the more expensive option.
        As long as the shoes are correctly sized, the material of construction
        is about personal choice based on “feel.”
        Know that canvas shoes will be easier to clean, as they are
        machine-washable.
        If you have younger children, you may look for ballet shoes that have
        pre-sewnelastics on them.<br></p>

      <h2 class="headFont">Hairstyle</h2>
      <p>
        Ideally, girls’ hair will be pulled back, very neatly into a bun
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P73C4Oea14&t=1s" id="vid-link" target="_blank">(Video)</a>.
        This is where the term “bunheads” comes from. There are a variety of
        ways to achieve this hairstyle, but one simple method is to brush your child’s hair until it is smooth;
        form it into a ponytail;
        then using an elastic or hair wrap to secure their hair tightly near
        the top of their hair.
        This is the classic ballerina bun, although many other variations
        are functional.
        If boys are sporting longer hair, it too, should be pulled back.</p>
