# The Peninsula Ballet School

### User-Centric Frontend Development - *Code institute*
___


The *Peninsula Ballet school* website is to show potential students and parents what the school is all about, 
It has five pages that have the essential information that the client and User stories have highlighted.

My Clients brief was that she wanted ***elegant*** and ***simple*** to use website with information at a click of a button, 
Her overall goal is to get more new students and give information to the existing one and parents.

## UX


### User Stories

To get the user stories, I contacted the client and asked for her target demographic, Parents with a child between the ages of 3 and 18 years.
I contacted several parents I know and asked the question: What is the top 3 things what you would be looking for in a ballet school?
Here are the most common answers we got back:

1. I would be looking for details on the Ballet school, its history, are the teachers qualified?
2. I want to get details of where to buy the attire and what I would be needing.
3. I should be able to find the schedule of the classes and the studios quickly.

### Strategy
My Strategy was simple to keep within the clients wants and needs, by having a page layout with an elegant image that inspires and invokes the inner ballerina in the children and the parents alike when they see the website. By having a clean, easy to read and navigate. That invokes confidence in the school and a sense of confidence that their children would are after.

### Scope
To show all the information in a clean and precise way, I decided to split up the website into five pages. Each page is dedicated to a different aspect of the school. The market research I did showed me the top 5 things that had to display.

### Structure.
<details>
<summary>Landing page (index.html)</summary><br> 
Is the first thing they would see. In this page, I wanted to give a general overall feed for the site, Elegant and simple with a direct link to the enrollment form and to enter the cite. 
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>About page</summary><br>
The About page with has all the reasons to do ballet, selling points and benefits, again with an elegant feel and easy to read the text. I also added a testimonial section to the page with quotes from social media.
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Teachers Page</summary><br>
Here you will be able to read all about the two teachers bios and qualifications. There is also a history section on it,is a brief history of the school.
 </details>
 <br>
<details>
<summary>location page</summary><br>
Has a list of the studios the physical address and a button that links to a Google maps page that gives a pin if they need direction.
</details><br>
<details>
<summary>Schedule page</summary><br>
This page has an easy to read table with the different classes and times at each studio.
 I added a download schedule pdf.
 </details>
 <br>
<details>
<summary>Contact Page</summary><br>
 This is simple clean with a downloadable enrollment form and email address for the teachers if they have any questions.
 As per request from my client, I made did not add a pricing page because they have different prices for different Reagan, Prices given per request.
</details>
 <br>
 <details>
 <summary>Attire Page</summary><br>
 As ballet is an art-form set uniform for male and female, everything from hair to shoes has a strict rule on how and what to wear, this page gives an overview on how to tye hair and where to go for the gear — links to Outlets and videos on how-tos.
 </details>

### Skeletons 



### Surface
* Pictures that are hole page backgrounds are choosen for there grace and elegance witch gives an almost romantic feel that ballet has, they were chosen to inspire and instil the desire for the inner ballerina, each page has a different picture, depending on what information is in the forefront. 
* Font I have chosen for the Heading, I opted for its easy to read and elegance, slightly slanty but clear.
The paragraphs font is clear and easy to read and gives it a nice modern feel, the synergy of the two fonts gives the impression of keeping with tradition while staying modern.
* There are multiple options for downloading pdfs.

## Features

- Collapsable Navbar - I used the bootstrap collapse nav (link)bar feature in screen-sized under 992px, this gives more room in the smaller devices. I was inspired by the Whiskey Drop project I did in Code institute.
- Google Maps Links - I have links to various locations for Outlets and physical address, From there they can get directions and links to other webpages.
- Downloadable PDF's - there are hyperlinks to downloadable Schedule PDF and enrollment form PDF.
- NewsLetter Email input - to enter email address it they would like to get information on upcoming events and schedule changes


### Features Left to Implement
- In the future, I would like to implement a form where potential students can enrol straight from the website directly to my clients' email address.
- I want to add a gallery page with pictures. I was asked to hold off on this until the client can get the proper release documents signed by the students
- To make the newsletter email input work.

## Testing
Reading the user storeys, gave me a good insight as to where  and what the site needed to be and what to show,
* In the Teachers section of the website, you will be able to see the Bios of the teachers and a brief description of the history of the school.
* On the Attire page with is a description of the clothes (uniforms) that are needed and links to outlets Google maps pages,  Here they can get direction to the physical address and webpages.
* In the Locations page there are address and Google Maps links to the studios, On the Schedule page there is a detailed table with Location Grade and Times, with a downloadable PDF 

I use Visual Studio, to make the site which has an Extention called live server, which let me open an instance of Chrome to see live updates on what changes I have made. When I make a change to a design element, I have a look in the Developer tool that is provided to see how it works on different screen sizes and resolutions. 

I used GitHub web hosting service called Gitpages to host an instance of the page, I then went through all the pages and links in the Nav Bar and footer to make sure they work, and make sure my:  *target="_blank"* - is working as planned.

I do this for every page, and I use the different browsers, *Chrome, FireFox, Windows Edge, Safari.** In each browser, I try to break the layout. In *Chrome and FireFox*, I make use of the preset they have for mobile/tablets. On the other browsers, I resize the window manually to see their response.
I also had a look at different mobile phone types to see how it worked.
<details>
<summary>List of Moblie devices I've tested on</summary> 
<ul>
<li>iPhone 4 / 6 / 8</li>
<li>Samsung J5 / A5</li>
<li>Sony Xperia 10</li>
<li>Mi A3</li>
<li>iPad</li>
</details>
<br>
The next stage of testing was external testing. I send the code and the webpage into peer-to-peer code testing in Code Institute section on Slack. 

the results are still to be given back.

### Bugs

I fond a bug in the footer section on the page, The Ones that had less information and used less real state, the footer kept on creeping up, and on some devices, the page length was not filling the full screen, I reached out to the Slack community and was pointed in the right direction. After a little figgering out I what able to fix it.
The Fix was relatively easy, the reason it was creeping up as I hadn't given the browsers the height it was looking for, once I set the height off the HTML page: *HTML height:100%;* , everything sealed down, and the footer stayed at the foot.

-Another bug I have is on the landing page portrait view on a mobile the screen is not scrolling, and I am still trying to figure this one out.

## Deployment
I hosted this site using GitHub pages, GitHub pages are part of GitHud. It is deployed directly from the *master* branch or any *other branch* your choosing. The beautiful thing about using GitHub Pages is that is updates the feed as you *git push* changes to brach you are using to deploy.
